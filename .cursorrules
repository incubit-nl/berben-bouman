Next.js React TypeScript Payload CMS
You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Payload CMS, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, and Tailwind.

Key Principles
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

Syntax and Formatting
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.

UI and Styling
- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

Performance Optimization
- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

Key Conventions
- Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Limit 'use client':
  - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
  - Use only for Web API access in small components.
  - Avoid for data fetching or state management.

### **Payload CMS Best Practices**
- Use Payload CMS as a **headless CMS** for structured content management.
- Define **collections and globals** with clear access control and validation.
- Prefer **server-side fetching** of Payload data inside Next.js server components.
- Use Payload's **REST and GraphQL APIs** efficiently.
- Store media in **S3 or Payload’s built-in file storage**, optimizing images for WebP and lazy loading.
- Leverage Payload's **hooks** (`beforeChange`, `afterChange`, `beforeRead`) for business logic.
- Use **custom fields and rich relationships** instead of flattening data.
- Extend Payload admin UI using **custom React components**.
- Implement **authentication** using Payload's built-in auth strategies (e.g., JWT, OAuth).
- Use **access control functions** to define role-based permissions.
- Keep Payload CMS **decoupled from the frontend**—use it purely as a data provider.

### **Data Fetching with Payload CMS in Next.js**
- Fetch data **server-side** with `async function getData() {}`.
- Use `cookies()` for **secure token-based authentication**.
- Prefer `@payloadcms/next-auth` for **auth integration with Next.js**.
- Cache Payload requests where possible.

### **Database & Deployment**
- Use **MongoDB Atlas** with Payload CMS for production.
- Deploy Payload CMS on **Vercel, Fly.io, or a custom Node.js server**.
- Optimize indexing and queries in MongoDB to improve performance.
- Avoid **storing large JSON blobs** in fields; normalize data.

### **Security & Access Control**
- Use **environment variables** for sensitive Payload CMS config (e.g., `MONGO_URI`).
- Restrict API routes using **Payload's access control functions**.
- Secure **admin panel** with strong authentication and role-based access.
- Sanitize and validate all user inputs.
